# Schoolpocalypse

Schoolpocalypse is an action-survival game set inside a college on the brink of chaos. After releasing the grades for the latest exam, a professor becomes the main target of a student uprising. Outraged by the results, the students arm themselves with whatever they can find — books, pencils, and even laptops — and embark on a relentless chase through the campus hallways.

Without understanding how things spiraled out of control so quickly, the professor embarks on a desperate escape, crossing various college environments — classrooms, courtyards, laboratories, and the parking lot. Dodging projectiles thrown by the enraged students, he remains determined in his mission: to reach the server room and format the system to erase all grades and, hopefully, restore order.

But the real twist comes after formatting: even with all records erased, the professor decides to retake the exam — reigniting the flames of rebellion and starting a new cycle of chaos.

Developed by third-semester Software Engineering students, Schoolpocalypse is a fast-paced satire of academic life, where exams can be deadly and the only way out is to run... or to format.
